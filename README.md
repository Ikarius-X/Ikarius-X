## Development Steps 

1. Create a homepage with a prompt for user input: The homepage will typically provide a button or link that the user can click to begin the process of inputting their mnemonic phrase.
2. Create a form for user input: In order to allow the user to enter their mnemonic phrase, you will need a form with fields that will allow the user to enter their phrase and record it.
3. Develop an algorithm to generate mnemonic phrases from user input: To develop an algorithm for generating mnemonic phrases, you will need to write logic that will take the user’s input phrase and group it together based on certain patterns or concepts.
4. Develop a feature to save mnemonic phrases: Once the algorithm has been developed, you will need to test it to ensure that it is saving the correct mnemonic phrases. You can do this by generating the correct mnemonic phrase and then logging it out for the user.
5. Test the app: Once the app has been developed, you will need to test it to ensure that it is functioning correctly. This will include testing the user interface, the app’s functionality, and any errors that may be causing the app to crash.
6. Document the app: After the app has been developed and tested, it is important to document the app so that you know how to use it and what areas it may need improvement. This will also help you maintain the app in the future.
